# Olympus admin app

In this repository you can find the admin version from the app Olympus. This project it's a combination from 3 parts, this one where we are right now, the client version of the app and the backend.

This project is basically a crud for admins to manipulate the data from users.

- [Backend](https://github.com/AleVallejoGarcia/Olympus_API)

## Node and library instalation
For the following step is required to have installed node. You can check out for more information in [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and we also need expo if you have node you should be able to install it with the following command:

```npm install -g expo-cli```

The initial step to execute this app is to be in console in the root folder of the project, because we need to execute some commands to run the app.

In the project root folder we first execute the next command to install the required libraries:

```npm i```

## Execute the app

First of all you should have the backend running, you cand find how to run it in it's own readme.

To execute the application we need to execute the next command:

```npm runt start```

With this command we will execute the app and then a QR code will appear, you can scan it and use it on your own phone with the expo go app, or by pressing a use it on an Android Emulator.
